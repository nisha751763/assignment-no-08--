        <h2>inforamtion</h2>
           <b>Sunflowers are tall plants with large flower heads that get their name from following the sun. The large "flower" is actually a composite flower head called a capitulum, made of many smaller florets. The plant is scientifically known as Helianthus annuus and is valuable for its seeds, from which edible oil is extracted, and for its ornamental use.</b> 
        <h4>Description and characteristics</h4>
           <b> Sunflowers can grow very tall, with some varieties reaching over 3 meters (10 feet). The stem is typically thick and hairy.
                Flower head: The large head, or capitulum, consists of an outer ring of large, yellow "ray" florets that attract pollinators, and a central disk of many smaller, fertile "disk" florets that mature into seeds.
                Leaves: They have large, oval, toothed leaves that are rough to the touch.
                Heliotropism: Immature flower buds exhibit heliotropism, moving to follow the sun from east to west. Once mature, the flower heads typically face east</b>
